This is not yet a serious project and is a basic script from a project I developed for a specific purpose. You are welcome to improve this, or raise the feature/bugfix request.

Download the executable from [here](https://github.com/ninethsense/FolderWatcher/tree/master/bin/Debug), if you are lazy to download and compile.
